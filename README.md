## Exploring gut microbial community composition over time

Our visualization explores a dataset of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiomes of 2 subjects over one year (David et al Genome Biology 2014). We chose to use an interactive stacked area chart, in which you can reorder or isolate taxonomic groups to compare their trends over time.
 potentially with an option to choose different taxonomic levels and zoom in on different stretches of time
This is an effective visualization strategy for this type of data because the stacked area plot is very intuitive for time series compositional (relative abundance) data. Switching between taxonomic levels is useful because both broad overview trends and specific interactions between species might be interesting, and zooming in and out is useful because both fine scale dynamics and large scale variation might be interesting.

## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here. (Tell us how to run your visualization.) 

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submission can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-jheer-domoritz-jasnyder/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

If you put your work online, please also write a [one-line description and add a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from the CSE512-15S page.

## Story Board

![story1](storyboard1.pdf)
![story2](storyboard2.pdf)
![story3](storyboard3.pdf)
![story4](storyboard4.pdf)

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here. Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

## Development Process

Include:
- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members. 
- A commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
  - Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
  - What aspects took the most time?
